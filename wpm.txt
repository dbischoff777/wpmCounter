December 17, 1903, is the birth date of all airplanes. Orville and Wilbur Wright started building gliders in 1900. In 1903, they built a motor and propeller for their glider. Orville made the first flight, which lasted 12 seconds, and flew 120 feet. Wilbur's flight was 852 feet in 59 seconds. These first flights in 1903 were just the start of the evolution of planes. By the year 1909, Bleriot had crossed the English Channel. By the year 1912, a two-piece plywood fuselage was built for greater strength. By the 1930s, the all-metal fuselage was tried, and it soon appeared in DC3s. From the Wrights' 1903 motor and prop came the engines for the 1950 turbojet that generated at least 19,600 pounds of thrust. The big Boeing 747 has four engines with 50,000 pounds of thrust each. The future holds an advanced super-sonic jet with a saving of almost 40 percent in fuel usage.
A transcription service is a business which converts speech (either live or recorded) into a written or electronic text document. Transcription services are often provided for business, legal, or medical purposes. The most common type of transcription is from a spoken-language source into text such as a computer file suitable for printing as a document such as a report. Common examples are the proceedings of a court hearing such as a criminal trial (by a court reporter) or a physician's recorded voice notes (medical transcription).
Two members of the 1984 class of Jefferson High School are chairing a group of 18 to look for a resort for the 20-year class reunion. A lovely place 78 miles from the city turns out to be the best. It has 254 rooms and a banquet hall to seat 378. It has been open 365 days per year since opening on May 30, 1926. They will need 450 to reserve the resort. Debbie Holmes was put in charge of buying 2,847 office machines for the entire firm. Debbie visited more than 109 companies in 35 states in 6 months. She will report to the board today in Room 2784 at 5 p.m. The board will consider her report about those 109 firms and recommend the top 2 or 3 brands to purchase. Debbie must decide before August 16. Lynn Greene said work started on the project March 27, 2003. The 246 blueprints were mailed to the office 18 days ago. The prints had to be 100 percent accurate before they were acceptable. The project should be finished by May 31, 2025. At that time there will be 47 new condominiums, each having at least 16 rooms. The building will be 25 stories.
